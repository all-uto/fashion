# 👗 FASHION/UTO — *Fashion of the Future*

> “Fashion engineered from the singularity — living interfaces that decode identity, amplify expression, and align us with the future.”

---

## ✨ Overview

**FASHION/UTO** explores the convergence of **style, consciousness, and technology** — where clothing becomes an *interface* between inner identity and collective evolution.  
This is **fashion as communication**, **fabric as code**, and **aesthetic as ethics**.

## 🧬 Vision

FASHION/UTO envisions a world where:
- Garments are **living interfaces** between biology and technology.  
- Expression becomes **a form of code** that transmits frequency and intent.  
- The wardrobe is a **manifestation layer** — translating spirit, emotion, and geometry into design.

Every stitch, every thread, every fiber is an invocation of **identity through innovation**.
